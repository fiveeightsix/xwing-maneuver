* What is it?

  It's a quiz. On what manoeuvres ships in X-Wing can do. X-Wing is a [[https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing/][game]]. 

  Hopefully, it will be of some use to those who do not yet possess encyclopedic knowledge of every manoeuvre dial in the game.

* Why?

  Upcoming store championship provided an excuse to further muck about with React and Flux.

* Thanks
